## 2. What is Markdown-Excel

As the name might suggest, Markdown-Excel is a tool to perform basic
Excel-like operations on a Markdown-Table. These operations range from simple
counting and analysing operations to highly complex and customizable operations
including formulas. 

## 3. How do I use it?

The usage of the tool is pretty straight forward. This tool takes advantage of
the **JShell** introduced in Java 9. All you have to do is to launch the JShell
import this library. After that you can use the tool in 2 different ways. You could
start typing a Markdown-Excel query right there in the prompt from the JShell. A more 
efficient alternative though is to create whats called a JShell-Script - basically
a plain-text file with Java-Sourcecode in it. By doing that you don't have to enter
the same queries every time.
